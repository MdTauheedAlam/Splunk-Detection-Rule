description: Malicious actors often abuse misconfigured LDAP servers or applications
  that use the LDAP servers in organizations. Outbound LDAP traffic should not be
  allowed outbound through your perimeter firewall.  This search will help determine
  if you have any LDAP connections to IP addresses outside of private (RFC1918) address
  space.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Zeek DNS and Zeek Conn data into Splunk. Zeek
  data should also be getting ingested in JSON format and should be mapped to the
  Network Traffic datamodels that are in use for this search.

known_false_positives: Unknown at this moment. Outbound LDAP traffic should not be
  allowed outbound through your perimeter firewall. Please check those servers to
  verify if the activity is legitimate.

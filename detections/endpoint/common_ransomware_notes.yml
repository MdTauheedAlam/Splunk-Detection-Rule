description: The search looks for files created with names matching those typically
  used in ransomware notes that tell the victim how to get their data back.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records file-system activity from
  your hosts to populate the Endpoint Filesystem data-model node. This is typically
  populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black, or
  via other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is
  typically generated via logs that report file-system reads and writes.
id: ada0f478-84a8-4641-a3f1-d82362d6bd71
known_false_positives: It's possible that a legitimate file could be created with
  the same name used by ransomware note files.

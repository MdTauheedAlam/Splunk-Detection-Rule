description: This detection targets behaviors observed in post exploit kits like Meterpreter
  and Koadic that are run in memory.  We have observed that these tools must invoke
  an excessive number of taskhost.exe and taskhostex.exe processes to complete various
  actions (discovery, lateral movement, etc.).  It is extremely uncommon in the course
  of normal operations to see so many distinct taskhost and taskhostex processes running
  concurrently in a short time frame.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting events
  related to processes on the endpoints that include the name of the process and process
  id into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.

known_false_positives: Administrators, administrative actions or certain applications
  may run many instances of taskhost and taskhostex concurrently.  Filter as needed.

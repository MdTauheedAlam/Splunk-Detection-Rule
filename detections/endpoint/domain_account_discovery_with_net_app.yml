description: This search is to detect a process command line for AD discovery. This
  techique is using the windows built in net.exe application to query AD users in
  the targetted machine. This techique was seen in several malware as part of there
  recon and can be a good pivot of analysis.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="net.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name="net1.exe") AND Processes.process = "* user*" AND Processes.process
  = "*/do*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.parent_process_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `domain_account_discovery_with_net_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

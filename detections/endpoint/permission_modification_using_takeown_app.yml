description: This search is to detect a modification of file or directory permission
  using takeown.exe windows app. This technique was seen in some ransomware that take
  the ownership of a folder or files to encrypt or delete it.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

description: This analytic will detect a suspicious process commandline related to
  windows defender exclusion feature. This command is abused by adversaries, malware
  author and red teams to bypassed Windows Defender Anti-Virus product by excluding  folder
  path, file path, process, extensions and etc. from its real time or schedule scan
  to execute their malicious code. This is a good indicator for defense evasion and
  to look further for events after this behavior.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.

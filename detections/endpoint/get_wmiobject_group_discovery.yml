description: The following hunting analytic identifies the use of `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group`
  being used with PowerShell to identify local groups on the endpoint. \ Typically,
  by itself, is not malicious but may raise suspicion based on time of day, endpoint
  and username. \ During triage, review parallel processes and identify any further
  suspicious behavior.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

description: The following analytic identifies usage of `wmic.exe` spawning a local
  or remote process, identified by the `node` switch. During triage, review parallel
  processes for additional commands executed. Look for any file modifications before
  and after `wmic.exe` execution. In addition, identify the remote endpoint and confirm
  execution or file modifications. Contain and isolate the endpoint as needed.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product. Deprecated because duplicate of Remote Process Instantiation via
  WMI.

known_false_positives: Administrators may use this legitimately to gather info from
  remote systems. Filter as needed.

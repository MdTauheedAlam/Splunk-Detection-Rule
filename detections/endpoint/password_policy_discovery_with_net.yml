- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a net application command to discover password
  policy. This commandline can be used by IT and admin to list all account domain
  policy but also can be use by attacker as part of recon. this hunting query can
  be a good pivot to locate credential dumping or lateral movement as part of post
  attack.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="net.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name="net1.exe") AND Processes.process = "*accounts*" AND Processes.process
  = "*/domain*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.parent_process_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `password_policy_discovery_with_net_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: network operator or admin may use this command

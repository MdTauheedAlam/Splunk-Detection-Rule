description: This search looks for events where `PsExec.exe` is run with the `accepteula`
  flag in the command line. PsExec is a built-in Windows utility that enables you
  to execute processes on other systems. It is fully interactive for console applications.
  This tool is widely used for launching interactive command prompts on remote systems.
  Threat actors leverage this extensively for executing code on compromised systems.
  If an attacker is running PsExec for the first time, they will be prompted to accept
  the end-user license agreement (EULA), which can be passed as the argument `accepteula`
  within the command line.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

known_false_positives: Administrators can leverage PsExec for accessing remote systems
  and might pass `accepteula` as an argument if they are running this tool for the
  first time. However, it is not likely that you'd see multiple occurrences of this
  event on a machine

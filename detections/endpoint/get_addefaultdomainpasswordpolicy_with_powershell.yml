description: This analytics is to detect a commandline related to Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy.
  This command can be used by attacker to mapped all password policy in a target host.
  This command may cause some noise especially in admin user that can execute this
  for policy audit. This hunting query is a good pivot to start investigating possible
  lateral movement or credential dumping as post attack.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="cmd.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name="powershell*") AND Processes.process = "*Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.parent_process_name

  | `get_addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: network operator may use this command

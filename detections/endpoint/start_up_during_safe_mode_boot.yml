description: This search is to detect a modification or registry add to the safeboot
  registry as an autostart mechanism. This technique was seen in some ransomware to
  automatically execute its code upon a safe mode boot.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.

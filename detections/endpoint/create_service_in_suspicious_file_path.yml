description: This detection is to identify a creation of "user mode service" where
  the service file path is located in non-common service folder in windows.
search: ' `wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045  Service_File_Name = "*\.exe" NOT (Service_File_Name
  IN ("C:\\Windows\\*", "C:\\Program File*", "C:\\Programdata\\*", "%systemroot%\\*"))
  Service_Type = "user mode service" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by EventCode Service_File_Name Service_Name Service_Start_Type Service_Type
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `create_service_in_suspicious_file_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.

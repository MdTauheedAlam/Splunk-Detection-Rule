description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious wmic commandlined that uninstall
  application non interactively. This technique was seen in IceID to uninstall av
  products to the compromised host to bypassed and evade detections. This Hunting
  query maybe a good indicator that some process tries to uninstall application using
  wmic which is not a common behavior. This approach may seen in some script or third
  part appication to uninstall their application but it is a good thing to check what
  it uninstall and why.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

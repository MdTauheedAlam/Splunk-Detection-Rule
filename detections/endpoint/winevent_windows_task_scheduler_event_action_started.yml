description: The following hunting analytic assists with identifying suspicious tasks
  that have been registered and ran in Windows using EventID 200 (action run) and
  201 (action completed). It is recommended to filter based on ActionName by specifying
  specific paths not used in your environment. After some basic tuning, this may be
  effective in capturing evasive ways to register tasks on Windows. Review parallel
  events related to tasks being scheduled. EventID 106 will generate when a new task
  is generated, however, that does not mean it ran. Capture any files on disk and
  analyze.
how_to_implement: Task Scheduler logs are required to be collected. Enable logging
  with inputs.conf by adding a stanza for [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational]
  and renderXml=false. Note, not translating it in XML may require a proper extraction
  of specific items in the Message.

known_false_positives: False positives will be present. Filter based on ActionName
  paths or specify keywords of interest.

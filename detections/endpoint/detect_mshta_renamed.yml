description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of mshta.exe executing.
  Mshta.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64. This
  analytic utilizes the internal name of the PE to identify if is the legitimate mshta
  binary. Further analysis should be performed to review the executed content and
  validation it is the real mshta.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of mshta.exe, but never renamed, triggering a false positive.

description: This analytic identifies suspicious series of attempt to kill multiple
  services on a system using either `net.exe` or `sc.exe`. This technique is use by
  adversaries to terminate security services or other related services to continue
  there objective and evade detections.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

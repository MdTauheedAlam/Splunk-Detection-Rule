description: This analytic identifies excessive usage of `taskkill.exe` application.
  This application is commonly used by adversaries to evade detections by killing
  security product processes or even other processes to evade detection.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed taskkill.exe may be used.

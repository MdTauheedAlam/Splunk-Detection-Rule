description: This search is to detect a suspicious execution wmi process that enumerate
  user in active directory. This technique can be used by attacker and pentester to
  mapped all the users as part of its recon to the targetted host. Network Admin may
  seen executing this command but not often and also not common to see in user events.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="cmd.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name="powershell*") AND Processes.process = "*get-wmiobject*"
  AND Processes.process = "*ds_user*" AND Processes.process = "*root\\directory\\ldap*"
  AND Processes.process = "*-namespace*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.parent_process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `getwmiobject_ds_user_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: network admin may execute this command.

description: The following analytic identifies the use of `reg.exe` exporting Windows
  Registry hives containing credentials. Adversaries may use this technique to export
  registry hives for offline credential access attacks. Typically found executed from
  a untrusted process or script. Upon execution, a file will be written to disk.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.

  positives. Filter as needed.

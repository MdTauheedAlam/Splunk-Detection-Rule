description: The following analytic identifies DiskCryptor  process name of dcrypt.exe
  or internal name dcinst.exe. This utility has been utilized by adversaries to encrypt
  disks manually during an operation. In addition, during install, a dcrypt.sys driver
  is installed and requires a reboot in order to take effect. There are no command-line
  arguments used.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

known_false_positives: It is possible false positives may be present based on the
  internal name dcinst.exe, filter as needed. It may be worthy to alert on the service
  name.

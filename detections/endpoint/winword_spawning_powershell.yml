description: The following detection identifies Microsoft Word spawning PowerShell.
  Typically, this is not common behavior and not default with winword.exe. Winword.exe
  will generally be found in the following path `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16`
  (version will vary). PowerShell spawning from winword.exe is common for a spearphishing
  attachment and is actively used. Albeit, the command executed will most likely be
  encoded and captured via another detection. During triage, review parallel processes
  and identify any files that may have been written.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if any are present,
  filter as needed.

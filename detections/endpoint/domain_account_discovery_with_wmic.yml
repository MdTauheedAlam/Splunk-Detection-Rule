description: This search is to detect a wmic command for enumerating user in active
  directory. This technique was commonly used in pentesting, red-team and also by
  some attacker to map all user in the targetted host. This search may also catch
  this type of query made by network admin but not common in all the user in the network.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="wmic.exe"
  AND Processes.process = "*/NAMESPACE:\\\\root\\directory\\ldap*" AND Processes.process
  = "*ds_user*" AND Processes.process = "*GET*" AND Processes.process = "*ds_samaccountname*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.parent_process_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `domain_account_discovery_with_wmic_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: network admin may execute this command for listing users.

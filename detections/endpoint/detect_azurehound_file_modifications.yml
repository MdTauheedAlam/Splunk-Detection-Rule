description: The following analytic is similar to SharpHound file modifications, but
  this instance covers the use of Invoke-AzureHound. AzureHound is the SharpHound
  equivilent but for Azure. It's possible this may never be seen in an environment
  as most attackers may execute this tool remotely. Once execution is complete, a
  zip file with a similar name will drop `20210601090751-azurecollection.zip`. In
  addition to the zip, multiple .json files will be written to disk, which are in
  the zip.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on file modifications that include the name of the process, and file, responsible
  for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem`
  node.

known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as the analytic is specific
  to a filename with extension .zip. Filter as needed.

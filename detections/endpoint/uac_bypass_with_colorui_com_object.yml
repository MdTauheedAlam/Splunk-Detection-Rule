description: This search is to detect a possible uac bypass using the colorui.dll
  COM Object. this technique was seen in so many malware and ransomware like lockbit
  where it make use of the colorui.dll COM CLSID to bypass UAC.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

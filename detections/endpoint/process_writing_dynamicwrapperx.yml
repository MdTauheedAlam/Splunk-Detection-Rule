description: DynamicWrapperX is an ActiveX component that can be used in a script
  to call Windows API functions, but it requires the dynwrapx.dll to be installed
  and registered. With that, a binary writing dynwrapx.dll to disk and registering
  it into the registry is highly suspect. Why is it needed? In most malicious instances,
  it will be written to disk at a non-standard location. During triage, review parallel
  processes and pivot on the process_guid. Review the registry for any suspicious
  modifications meant to load dynwrapx.dll. Identify any suspicious module loads of
  dynwrapx.dll. This will identify the process that will invoke vbs/wscript/cscript.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Filesystem`
  node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the
  latest TA for the endpoint product.

known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, however it is possible to
  filter by Processes.process_name and specific processes (ex. wscript.exe). Filter
  as needed. This may need modification based on EDR telemetry and how it brings in
  registry data. For example, removal of (Default).

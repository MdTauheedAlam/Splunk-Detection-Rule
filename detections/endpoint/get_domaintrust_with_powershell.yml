description: This analytic identifies Get-DomainTrust from PowerView in order to gather
  domain trust information. Typically, this is utilized within a script being executed
  and used to enumerate the domain trust information. This grants the adversary an
  understanding of how large or small the domain is. During triage, review parallel
  processes using an EDR product or 4688 events. It will be important to understand
  the timeline of events around this activity.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

known_false_positives: Limited false positives as this requires an active Administrator
  or adversary to bring in, import, and execute.

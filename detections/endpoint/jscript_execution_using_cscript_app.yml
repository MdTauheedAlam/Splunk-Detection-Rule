description: This search is to detect a execution of jscript using cscript process.
  Commonly when a user run jscript file it was executed by wscript.exe application.
  This technique was seen in FIN7 js implant to execute its malicious script using
  cscript process. This behavior is uncommon and a good artifacts to check further
  anomalies within the network
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

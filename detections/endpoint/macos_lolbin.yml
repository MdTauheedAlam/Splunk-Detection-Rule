description: Detect multiple executions of Living off the Land (LOLbin) binaries in a
  short period of time. 
search: '`osquery` name=es_process_events columns.cmdline IN ("find*", "crontab*", "screencapture*", "openssl*", "curl*", "wget*", "killall*", "funzip*")
  | rename columns.* as *
  | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(cmdline) as cmdline, values(pid) as pid, values(parent) as parent, values(path) as path, 
  values(signing_id) as signing_id,  dc(path) as dc_path by username host
  | rename username as User, cmdline as process, path as process_path
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `macos_lolbin_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection uses osquery and endpoint security on MacOS.
  Follow the link in references, which describes how to setup process auditing in MacOS
  with endpoint security and osquery.

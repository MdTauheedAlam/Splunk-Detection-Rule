datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search looks for command-line arguments where `cmd.exe /c` is used
  to execute a program. This technique is commonly seen in adversaries and malware
  to execute batch command using different shell like powershell or different process
  other than cmd.exe. This is a good hunting query for suspicious commandline made
  by a script or relative process execute it.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_cmd` AND Processes.process="*
  /c *" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `cmd_carry_out_string_command_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

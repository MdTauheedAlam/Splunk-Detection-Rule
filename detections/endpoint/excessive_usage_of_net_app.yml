description: This analytic identifies excessive usage of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` within
  a bucket of time (1 minute). This behavior was seen in a Monero incident where the
  adversary attempts to create many users, delete and disable users as part of its
  malicious behavior.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

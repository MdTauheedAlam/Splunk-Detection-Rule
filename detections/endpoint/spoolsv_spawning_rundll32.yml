datamodel:
- Endpoint
date: '2021-07-01'
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious child process, `rundll32.exe`,
  with no command-line arguments being spawned from `spoolsv.exe`. This was identified
  during our testing of CVE-2021-34527 previously (CVE-2021-1675) or PrintNightmare.
  Typically, this is not normal behavior for `spoolsv.exe` to spawn a process. During
  triage, isolate the endpoint and review for source of exploitation. Capture any
  additional file modification events.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

known_false_positives: Limited false positives have been identified. There are limited
  instances where `rundll32.exe` may be spawned by a legitimate print driver.

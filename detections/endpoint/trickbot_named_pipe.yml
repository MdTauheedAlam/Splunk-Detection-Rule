description: this search is to detect potential trickbot infection through the create/connected
  named pipe to the system. This technique is used by trickbot to communicate to its
  c2 to post or get command during infection.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and pipename from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon,
  you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. .

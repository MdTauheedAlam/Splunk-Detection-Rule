description: This search is to detect a suspicious file creation of sqlite3.dll in
  %temp% folder. This behavior was seen in IcedID malware where it download sqlite
  module to parse browser database like for chrome or firefox to stole browser information
  related to bank, credit card or credentials.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

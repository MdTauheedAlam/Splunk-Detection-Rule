description: The following detection identifies rundll32.exe with `control_rundll`
  within the command-line, loading a .cpl or another file type from windows\temp,
  programdata, or appdata. Developed in relation to CVE-2021-40444. Rundll32.exe can
  also be used to execute Control Panel Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented
  shell32.dll functions Control_RunDLL and Control_RunDLLAsUser. Double-clicking a
  .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. This is written to be a bit more
  broad by not including .cpl. The paths are specified, add more as needed. During
  triage, review parallel processes to identify any further suspicious behavior.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
id: 1adffe86-10c3-11ec-8ce6-acde48001122
known_false_positives: This may be tuned, or a new one related, by adding .cpl to
  command-line. However, it's important to look for both. Tune/filter as needed.

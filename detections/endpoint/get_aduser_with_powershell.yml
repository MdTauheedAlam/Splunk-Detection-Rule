datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a suspicious commandline that commonly uses
  for enumerating users in active directory. This  technique can be a good indicator
  to hunt further TTPs to the machine to check further anomalies. Since this is a
  hunt query expect some noise from administrator or some IT within the network that
  may use this command.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="cmd.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name="powershell*") AND Processes.process = "*Get-ADUser*"
  AND Processes.process = "*-filter*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.parent_process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `get_aduser_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: network admin may use this command.

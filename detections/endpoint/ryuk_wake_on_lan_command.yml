description: This Splunk query identifies the use of Wake-on-LAN utilized by Ryuk
  ransomware. The Ryuk Ransomware uses the Wake-on-Lan feature to turn on powered
  off devices on a compromised network to have greater success encrypting them. This
  is a high fidelity indicator of Ryuk ransomware executing on an endpoint. Upon triage,
  isolate the endpoint. Additional file modification events will be within the users
  profile (\appdata\roaming) and in public directories (users\public\). Review all
  Scheduled Tasks on the isolated endpoint and across the fleet. Suspicious Scheduled
  Tasks will include a path to a unknown binary and those endpoints should be isolated
  until triaged.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.

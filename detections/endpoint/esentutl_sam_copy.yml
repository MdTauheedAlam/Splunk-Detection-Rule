description: The following analytic identifies the process - `esentutl.exe` - being
  used to capture credentials stored in ntds.dit or the SAM file on disk. During triage,
  review parallel processes and determine if legitimate activity. Upon determination
  of illegitimate activity, take further action to isolate and contain the threat.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

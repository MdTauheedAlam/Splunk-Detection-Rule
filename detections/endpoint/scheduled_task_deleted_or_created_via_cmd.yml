date: '2022-02-22'
description: The following analytic identifies the creation or deletion of a scheduled
  task using schtasks.exe with flags - create or delete being passed on the command-line.
  This has been associated with the Dragonfly threat actor, and the SUNBURST attack
  against Solarwinds. This analytic replaces "Scheduled Task used in BadRabbit Ransomware".
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

known_false_positives: It is possible scripts or administrators may trigger this analytic.
  Filter as needed based on parent process, application.

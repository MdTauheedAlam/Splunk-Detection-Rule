description: This search looks for flags passed to schtasks.exe on the command-line
  that indicate a task was created via command like. This has been associated with
  the Dragonfly threat actor, and the SUNBURST attack against Solarwinds.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.

known_false_positives: Tasks should not be manually created via CLI, this is rarely
  done by admins as well

description: The following analytic identifies rundll32.exe using dllregisterserver
  on the command line to load a DLL. When a DLL is registered, the DllRegisterServer
  method entry point in the DLL is invoked. This is typically seen when a DLL is being
  registered on the system. Not every instance is considered malicious, but it will
  capture malicious use of it. During investigation, review the parent process and
  parrellel processes executing. Capture the DLL being loaded and inspect further.
  Rundll32.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

known_false_positives: This is likely to produce false positives and will require
  some filtering. Tune the query by adding command line paths to known good DLLs,
  or filtering based on parent process names.

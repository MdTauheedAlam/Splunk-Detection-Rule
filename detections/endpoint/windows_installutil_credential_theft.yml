description: 'The following analytic identifies the Windows InstallUtil.exe binary
  loading `vaultcli.dll` and Samlib.dll`. This technique may be used to execute code
  to bypassing application control and capture credentials by utilizing a tool like
  MimiKatz. \

  When `InstallUtil.exe` is used in a malicous manner, the path to an executable on
  the filesystem is typically specified. Take note of the parent process. In a suspicious
  instance, this will be spawned from a non-standard process like `Cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`
  or `Explorer.exe`. \

  If used by a developer, typically this will be found with multiple command-line
  switches/arguments and spawn from Visual Studio. \

  During triage review resulting network connections, file modifications, and parallel
  processes. Capture any artifacts and review further.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and module loads from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.

known_false_positives: Typically this will not trigger as by it's very nature InstallUtil
  does not need credentials. Filter as needed.

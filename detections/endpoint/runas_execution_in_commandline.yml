description: This analytic look for a spawned runas.exe process with a administrator
  user option parameter. This parameter was abused by adversaries, malware author
  or even red teams to gain elevated privileges in target host. This is a good hunting
  query to figure out privilege escalation tactics that may used for different stages
  like lateral movement but take note that administrator may use this command in purpose
  so its better to see other event context before and after this analytic.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

known_false_positives: A network operator or systems administrator may utilize an
  automated or manual execute this command that may generate false positives. filter
  is needed.

description: A required step while exploiting the CVE-2021-44228-Log4j vulnerability
  is that the victim server will perform outbound connections to attacker-controlled
  infrastructure. This is required as part of the JNDI lookup as well as for retrieving
  the second stage .class payload. The following analytic identifies the Java process
  reaching out to default ports used by the LDAP and RMI protocols. This behavior
  could represent successfull exploitation. Note that adversaries can easily decide to use
  arbitrary ports for these protocols and potentially bypass this detection. 
search: ' `sysmon` EventCode=3  (process_name=java OR process_name=java.exe) (DestinationPort=389
  OR DestinationPort=1389 OR DestinationPort = 1099 ) | rename Computer as dest |  stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, process_name, DestinationPort
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `outbound_network_connection_from_java_using_default_ports_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Legitimate Java applications may use perform outbound connections
  to these ports. Filter as needed

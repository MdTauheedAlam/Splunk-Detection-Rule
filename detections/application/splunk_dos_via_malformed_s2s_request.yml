description: On March 24th, 2022, Splunk published a security advisory for a possible Denial of Service stemming from the lack of validation in a specific key-value field in the Splunk-to-Splunk (S2S) protocol. This detection will alert on attempted exploitation in patched versions of Splunk. 
search: '`splunkd` log_level=ERROR component=TcpInputProc thread_name=FwdDataReceiverThread | table host, src | `splunk_dos_via_malformed_s2s_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the _internal index. This detection will only find attempted exploitation on versions of Splunk already patched for CVE-2021-3422.

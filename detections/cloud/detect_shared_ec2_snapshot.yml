description: The following analytic utilizes AWS CloudTrail events to identify when
  an EC2 snapshot permissions are modified to be shared with a different AWS account.
  This method is used by adversaries to exfiltrate the EC2 snapshot.
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
id: 2a9b80d3-6340-4345-b5ad-290bf3d222c4
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately shared a
  snapshot with others for  a specific purpose.

description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events where a user created a policy
  version that allows them to access any resource in their account
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
id: 2a9b80d3-6340-4345-b5ad-212bf3d0dac4
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a policy to allow a user to access all
  resources. That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to all
  AWS resources
name: AWS Create Policy Version to allow all resources

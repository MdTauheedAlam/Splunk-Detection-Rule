description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events from AWS Elastic Container
  Service (ECR). A upload of a new container is normally done from only a few known
  users. When the user was never seen before, we should have a closer look into the
  event.
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.

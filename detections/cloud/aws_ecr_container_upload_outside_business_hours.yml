description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events from AWS Elastic Container
  Service (ECR). A upload of a new container is normally done during business hours.
  When done outside business hours, we want to take a look into it.
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.

known_false_positives: When your development is spreaded in different time zones,
  applying this rule can be difficult.

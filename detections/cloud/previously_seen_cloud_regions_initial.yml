description: This search looks for cloud compute events where a compute instance is
  started and creates a baseline of most recent time, `lastTime` and the first time
  `firstTime` we've seen this region in our dataset grouped by the region for the
  last 30 days
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting the approrpiate cloud infrastructure logs
  and have the Security Research cloud data model installed.

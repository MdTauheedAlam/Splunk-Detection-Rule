description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events where a user A(victim A)
  creates a login profile for user B, followed by a AWS Console login event from user
  B from the same src_ip as user B. This correlated event can be indicative of privilege
  escalation since both events happened from the same src_ip
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.

known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a login profile for another user.

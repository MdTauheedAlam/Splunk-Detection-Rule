description: The following detection identifies any malformed policy document exceptions
  with a status of `failure`. A malformed policy document exception occurs in instances
  where roles are attempted to be assumed, or brute forced. In a brute force attempt,
  using a tool like CloudSploit or Pacu, an attempt will look like `arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/aws-service-role/rds.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForRDS`.  Meaning,
  when an adversary is attempting to identify a role name, multiple failures will
  occur. This detection focuses on the errors of a remote attempt that is failing.
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS Cloudtrail logs. Set the `where count` greater
  than a value to identify suspicious activity in your environment.

known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users.

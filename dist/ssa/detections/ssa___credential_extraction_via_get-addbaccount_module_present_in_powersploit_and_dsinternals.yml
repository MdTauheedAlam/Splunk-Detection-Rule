  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. Credential
  extraction is often an illegal recovery of credential material from secured authentication
  resources and repositories. This process may also involve decryption or other transformations
  of the stored credential material. PowerSploit and DSInternals are common exploit
  APIs offering PowerShell modules for various exploits of Windows and Active Directory
  environments.'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Windows Security logs from devices of interest,
  including the event ID 4688 with enabled command line logging.

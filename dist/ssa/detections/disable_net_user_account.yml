description: This analytic will identify a suspicious command-line that disables a
  user account using the `net.exe` utility native to Windows. This technique may used
  by the adversaries to interrupt availability of such users to do their malicious
  act.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe/net1.exe may be
  used.

known_false_positives: network operator may use this approach to quickly disable an
  account but not a common practice.

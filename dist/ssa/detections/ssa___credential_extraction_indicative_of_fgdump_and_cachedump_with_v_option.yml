  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. The following
  analytic identifies the use of CacheDump with the `-v` parameter to dump cached
  credentials on the associated endpoint. Adversaries use Cachedump as it is a publicly-available
  tool that extracts cached password hashes from a system''s registry.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

known_false_positives: False positives will be limited as this analytic targets specific
  credential dumping process names. Filter as needed.
